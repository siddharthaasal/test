                content: "In today's rapidly evolving business environment, third-party risk management (TPRM) has become a critical area of focus for organizations worldwide. As businesses expand their reliance on external vendors, suppliers, and service providers, the complexity of assessing third-party risks has increased exponentially. This rise in complexity is fueled by several factors, including globalization, cybersecurity threats, regulatory pressures, climate-related disruptions, lack of credible data for verification, and the growing sophistication of supply chain networks. Organizations must now navigate a dynamic and often opaque risk landscape, making traditional approaches to third-party risk assessment inadequate."
